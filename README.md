# Libert√©
This is a full-stack e-commerce web application that utilizes [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to accept payments. In this application, users can add products into their cart, update the number of items in the cart, and then checkout with their billing/shipping information in order to make a payment via Stripe. This app is powered by [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the client-side, and [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) for the server-side.
